# SVG Dumpster

I work on SVG files often so needed a repo to reference my previous creations.

There's usually something unique about each file that can be reused in the future.

### purple-ellipse
<ul>
  <li>color-interpolation-filters="sRGB" makes Gaussian blurs look much nicer.</li>
  <li>stdDeviation="0 25" turns Gaussian blur into Motion blur, in "X Y" format.</li>
  <li>gradientTransform="scale(1,0.7)" turns circular into oval gradient.</li>
  <li>transform-origin="center bottom" sets the transform pivot point.</li>
</ul>

### svgenout
<ul>
  <li>output files from my SVGen project.</li>
  <li>generally easy on the eyes as only the nice ones were saved.</li>
  <li>depending on the file, a variety of filters are included.</li>
  <li>depending on the file, some include cool shapes.</li>
</ul>
