# SVG Dumpster

I work on SVG files often so needed a repo to reference my previous creations.

There's usually something unique about each file that can be reused in the future.

### purple-ellipse
<ul>
  <li>color-interpolation-filters="sRGB" makes Gaussian blurs look much nicer.</li>
  <li>stdDeviation="0 25" turns Gaussian blur into Motion blur, in "X Y" format.</li>
</ul>
